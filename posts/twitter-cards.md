I recently tried sharing a post on Twitter about my website [Denki Carbon](https://denkicarbon.jp) and came up against...something terrifing...

Very Spooky 💀🎃 and it also looks kinda bad right?  

Now, I thought this would be an easy fix, but I just sunk like _3 terrifying and nightmarish hours_ into this _dastardly experiment of my own invention_ so I'm here to _regale_ to you my _tale of woe and tragedy_ so that _**YOU** my child shall not befall such a fate as **I**..._ so yeah _lend me thine ears_ etc. etc. Spooktober 💀🎃
