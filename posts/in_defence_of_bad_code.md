# In Defence of Bad Code

Since graduating from Code Chrysalis, I've been "helping out around the house", teaching Foundations as a part-time instructor, as well as helping out with mock interviews for graduating immersive students. One question has come up repeatedly in various forms:

And my response is usually something along the lines of:

> You don't.

So I wanted to elaborate on that.
